## 🏗️ Build Fixes Applied

### 1. Dynamic Rendering Configuration
Added `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to prevent build-time database queries:
- ✅ `/dashboard/page.tsx`
- ✅ `/dashboard/universities/page.tsx`
- ✅ `/universities/page.tsx`
- ✅ `/universities/[slug]/page.tsx`

### 2. Error Handling
Added try-catch blocks to handle missing database gracefully:
- ✅ Dashboard stats function returns zeros if DB unavailable
- ✅ University queries handle errors properly

### 3. Created Missing Legal Pages
- ✅ Privacy Policy page with comprehensive sections
- ✅ Terms of Service page with user agreement details
- ✅ Cookie Policy page with cookie information
